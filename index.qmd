I'm Fourth-year Finance Honors and Accounting student the University of Alberta with a strong interest in commodity and securities trading, risk management, consumer credit & economics.

On this webpage you'll find a series of projects I've completed; topics range from algorithmic trading models to economic analyses in the consumer credit space. This site is intended to serve as a platform to highlight topics I find interesting through the application of data science skills I've acquired as a student and Analyst at Trust Science.
