R Squared will likely reduce trade model efficacy"

Crude storages are higher than anticipated.\nRBOB has taken a bigger hit than Crude, dropping the Crack Spread to yearly lows. Dec/March cx time spread is trading at decade lows.\nWe believe the market is over reacting to the short term bad news. Supply/demand balances will become more favorable for refineries in the short term, reducing the spread between the RBOB crack in December relative to February.\nStorage Levels, see Exhibits 3\n\n\n\nRisk Appetite & Desired Exposure\n\nWe are trading spreads, not the flat price\nWe are confident in our market call and see little downside risk.\n\n\n\nExecution & Monetization Strategies\n\nWe are betting on the profitability of gasoline refining to increase in the short term.\nLong Dec 2023 RBOB Crack Spread\nShort Feb 2024 RBOB Crack Spread\nIndicators to look out for:\n\nBull: Increase in demand relative to supply\nBear: Increase in gasoline stocks in the short term.\n\n\n\n\nDecisions\n\nSold on Nov 7 when the time spread approached 0 (our profit-taking level), which was the mean of the spread.\nIn the following 2 weeks, our closed position kept on rising portraying the market’s reversal on Dec RBOB crack spread sentiment. We did not see any upside in continuing the position after it had reversed to its mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade 2\n\nMarket View\n\nBullish on the RBOB Crack Spread in the short term\nImplied storage expected to remain relatively constant, with slight draws\nThe expectation of contributed stabilization of storage level combined with relatively low crude prices suggests that the relatively small crack spread, when compared to previous years, will move in a mean-reverting direction in the near term\n\n\nRisk Appetite & Desired Exposure\n\nModerate risk without taking RBOB flat price exposure\nWe wanted to limit price swings approximately +/- 150k per day; thus, we selected 100k BBL as our position size, per recent daily P&L swings.\n\n\n\nExecution & Monetization Strategies\n\nLong January 2024 RBOB contracts and short January 2024 WTI contracts, giving us a long position on the January RBOB Crack Spread\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade 3\n\nMarket View\n\nOur supply & demand model in the short term is forcasting small storage draws. RBOB prices have recently taken a bit of a hit, which can be attributable to the time of the year and speculative fears surrounding world events. This is pictured in our supply & demand curve showing a stint of implied storage fills before entering our position. We believe the price was driven below our perceived market value by speculative fears in the short term. We are Bullish in the near term.\n\n\n\nRisk Appetite & Desired Exposure\n\nModerate to low risk, with some hedged exposure. See exhibit 6 and note that daily PL generally hovers between 0.5 and -0.5. We chose this spread to limit our daily PL to 150,000.\n\n\n\nExecution & Monetization Strategies\n\nLong the Front contract (Dec), short the 4th contract (Mar) time spread. This was put in place to expose us to any price increases from implied storage draws while using the term structure to hedge some of the volatility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade 3b\nUpon learning about how to implement hedge ratios, we wanted to correctly hedge our time spread position to maximize profit. Below shows the contract betas as they progress further into the future:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec/March Hedge ratio\n\nNew hedge ratio for Dec/March RBOB Spread: 0.5938231\nWe then closed our position and reopened with the correct ratio in accordance with the calculations above.\nNew Exposure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal P/L"

The different blends and blending components sent us down a rabbit hole of research. After tirelessly attempting to construct a supply & demand balance for RBOB by combining the different components and their relative import/export data, we cut our losses and opted to go with total finished gasoline to perform our market analysis.\nIn recognizing the limitations of our model and its ability to mirror the economics of RBOB itself, we were uneasy with taking on a lot of risk solely based on our SD model.\nLimited Public news. We learned that commodities like RBOB have very few public and timely news sources, pushing us to really dig for news and reflect to draw our own conclusions, rather than having a clear market status delivered to us.\nTrading on a weekly time horizon highlights the importance of timing your entries and exits correctly.

    "text": "Following is a summary of the analysis on select asset class returns on the NYSE and NASDAQ, the two largest stock exchanges globally. Representing returns for each asset class is a specific Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that allows investors to gain exposure to various asset prices without physically possessing underlying asset.\n\nAnalysed asset classes: Gold via the SPDR Gold Trust (Ticker: GLD), US equities via the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (Ticker: SPY), Energy Liquids via the United States Oil ETF (Ticker: USO), US Long Term bonds via the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (Ticker: TLT), and Real Estate via the Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund (Ticker: VNQ).\n\n\n\n\nAll included asset classes had negatively skewed logarithmic returns.\n\nExtreme negative returns were more frequently observed than extreme positive returns across all asset classes.\nReal Estate had the largest negative skew.\n\nUS equities generated the highest mean daily return, and Energy Liquids generated the lowest, with daily average returns of 0.0416% and -0.0609%, respectively.\nGold returns had the lowest volatility of the compared asset classes, and Energy Liquids had the highest.\nUS equities and Real Estate prices had the strongest positive correlation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.44.\n\nUS Equities and Real Estate prices tended to move in the same direction, whether that be positive or negative.\n\nEnergy Liquid and Gold prices were positively correlated at an abnormally high level in 2022.\n\nPossibly related to high inflation in 2022 that was in part driven by high energy prices.\n\nAsset returns were not normally distributed.\n\nReturns were not symmetric about the mean, and differed from a bell curve distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, these histograms provide a visual representation of the distribution of returns for the asset classes within the analysis. This distribution provides insights as to how frequent and extreme outlier (or anomalous) returns are within each asset class.\n\nEnergy Liquids had comparatively large outlier returns, suggesting that a risk-averse individual would prefer to invest in other asset classes with less extreme outliers, such as US Long Term bonds or Gold. Investing in asset classes that are historically less prone to large movements, both individually or with the market as a whole, reduces the risk of extreme portfolio losses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTicker\nMean\nStd.Dev\nSkewness\nKurtosis\n\n\n\n\nGLD\n0.018186%\n0.892986%\n-0.1063539\n6.041964\n\n\nSPY\n0.041575%\n1.134011%\n-0.8134746\n16.898902\n\n\nTLT\n0.010795%\n0.924014%\n-0.0014229\n8.772180\n\n\nUSO\n-0.060927%\n2.561366%\n-1.5977531\n21.700870\n\n\nVNQ\n0.029684%\n1.309078%\n-1.8093719\n32.620988\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplementing the above visualizations, these table provide numeric representations as to the frequency (kurtosis) and general direction (skewness) of outlier returns within each asset class. A large kurtosis value indicates that the asset class had more extreme returns, and the skewness value indicates the general direction of these extreme returns (positive or negative). Real Estate had the largest kurtosis and negative skew of the compared assets, and with Energy Liquids generating the second largest statistic in both.\n\nAlso included in the table is the mean daily return across the analysis, as well as the standard deviation of returns. These both provide a long term view on asset performance, with mean highlighting average returns, and standard deviation highlighting the relative volatility of each asset class. Gold returns had the lowest volatility within the analysis, and Energy Liquids had the largest. These observed statistics are in keeping with the past underlying price trends of either asset, with energy revenues traditionally being more cyclical and subject to prevailing oil prices, and gold representing an asset that reduces investors exposure to market cycles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis correlation matrix provides correlation coefficients for the asset classes within the analysis, indicating the strength and direction of the linear relationship between each asset class. A correlation of +1 describes a perfect positive relationship, where the increase in one asset price has exact proportional increase in the other asset price.\n\nThese correlations can be used to inform investment decisions such as an investor wanting to diversify a large position or speculate on the decline of specific asset class. The -0.18 correlation between US securities and Long Term US bonds highlighted the ability for fixed income securities to offset price movements in the equity market, explaining why some fund manager maintain a specific percent exposure to either asset class. Another notable takeaway is the relatively high correlation of 0.44 between Real Estate and US equities, given that many retail investors largest exposure is Real Estate via home ownership, but yet they continue to primarily invest in equities. This behavior means that some retail investors would see larger diversification benefits if they invested in other asset classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs highlighted by the correlation coefficient of 0.05 in the matrix and overall unpredictability across the analysis window, Energy Liquids and Gold prices typically don’t have a strong consistent correlation, positive or negative. Interestingly, this trend seems to have changed in 2022, with Energy Liquids and Gold appearing to show a strong positive correlation over the rolling windows.

    "text": "Summary of Analysis\nFollowing is a summary of the analysis on select asset class returns on the NYSE and NASDAQ, the two largest stock exchanges globally. Representing returns for each asset class is a specific Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that allows investors to gain exposure to various asset prices without physically possessing underlying asset.\n\nAnalysed asset classes: Gold via the SPDR Gold Trust (Ticker: GLD), US equities via the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (Ticker: SPY), Energy Liquids via the United States Oil ETF (Ticker: USO), US Long Term bonds via the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (Ticker: TLT), and Real Estate via the Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund (Ticker: VNQ).\n\n\nAnalysis Window: 2014/01/01 - 2023/01/31\n\nAll included asset classes had negatively skewed logarithmic returns.\n\nExtreme negative returns were more frequently observed than extreme positive returns across all asset classes.\nReal Estate had the largest negative skew.\n\nUS equities generated the highest mean daily return, and Energy Liquids generated the lowest, with daily average returns of 0.0416% and -0.0609%, respectively.\nGold returns had the lowest volatility of the compared asset classes, and Energy Liquids had the highest.\nUS equities and Real Estate prices had the strongest positive correlation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.44.\n\nUS Equities and Real Estate prices tended to move in the same direction, whether that be positive or negative.\n\nEnergy Liquid and Gold prices were positively correlated at an abnormally high level in 2022.\n\nPossibly related to high inflation in 2022 that was in part driven by high energy prices.\n\nAsset returns were not normally distributed.\n\nReturns were not symmetric about the mean, and differed from a bell curve distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, these histograms provide a visual representation of the distribution of returns for the asset classes within the analysis. This distribution provides insights as to how frequent and extreme outlier (or anomalous) returns are within each asset class.\n\nEnergy Liquids had comparatively large outlier returns, suggesting that a risk-averse individual would prefer to invest in other asset classes with less extreme outliers, such as US Long Term bonds or Gold. Investing in asset classes that are historically less prone to large movements, both individually or with the market as a whole, reduces the risk of extreme portfolio losses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTicker\nMean\nStd.Dev\nSkewness\nKurtosis\n\n\n\n\nGLD\n0.018186%\n0.892986%\n-0.1063539\n6.041964\n\n\nSPY\n0.041575%\n1.134011%\n-0.8134720\n16.898902\n\n\nTLT\n0.010795%\n0.924014%\n-0.0014237\n8.772180\n\n\nUSO\n-0.060927%\n2.561366%\n-1.5977531\n21.700870\n\n\nVNQ\n0.029684%\n1.309079%\n-1.8093665\n32.620881\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplementing the above visualizations, these table provide numeric representations as to the frequency (kurtosis) and general direction (skewness) of outlier returns within each asset class. A large kurtosis value indicates that the asset class had more extreme returns, and the skewness value indicates the general direction of these extreme returns (positive or negative). Real Estate had the largest kurtosis and negative skew of the compared assets, and with Energy Liquids generating the second largest statistic in both.\n\nAlso included in the table is the mean daily return across the analysis, as well as the standard deviation of returns. These both provide a long term view on asset performance, with mean highlighting average returns, and standard deviation highlighting the relative volatility of each asset class. Gold returns had the lowest volatility within the analysis, and Energy Liquids had the largest. These observed statistics are in keeping with the past underlying price trends of either asset, with energy revenues traditionally being more cyclical and subject to prevailing oil prices, and gold representing an asset that reduces investors exposure to market cycles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis correlation matrix provides correlation coefficients for the asset classes within the analysis, indicating the strength and direction of the linear relationship between each asset class. A correlation of +1 describes a perfect positive relationship, where the increase in one asset price has exact proportional increase in the other asset price.\n\nThese correlations can be used to inform investment decisions such as an investor wanting to diversify a large position or speculate on the decline of specific asset class. The -0.18 correlation between US securities and Long Term US bonds highlighted the ability for fixed income securities to offset price movements in the equity market, explaining why some fund manager maintain a specific percent exposure to either asset class. Another notable takeaway is the relatively high correlation of 0.44 between Real Estate and US equities, given that many retail investors largest exposure is Real Estate via home ownership, but yet they continue to primarily invest in equities. This behavior means that some retail investors would see larger diversification benefits if they invested in other asset classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs highlighted by the correlation coefficient of 0.05 in the matrix and overall unpredictability across the analysis window, Energy Liquids and Gold prices typically don’t have a strong consistent correlation, positive or negative. Interestingly, this trend seems to have changed in 2022, with Energy Liquids and Gold appearing to show a strong positive correlation over the rolling windows. A possible explanation for this recent change is the high inflation observed in 2022 that was partially driven by high energy prices. These high energy prices increased the revenues for many energy producers, while simultaneously, investors ‘fled’ to gold as an asset reduce exposure to inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTicker\nStatistic\nP.Value\nMethod\n\n\n\n\nGLD\n884.9348\n0\nJarque Bera Test\n\n\nSPY\n18636.1477\n0\nJarque Bera Test\n\n\nTLT\n3170.7695\n0\nJarque Bera Test\n\n\nUSO\n34253.6999\n0\nJarque Bera Test\n\n\nVNQ\n84745.1405\n0\nJarque Bera Test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jarque Bera Test measures whether sample data has skewness and kurtosis matching that of a normal distribution.
